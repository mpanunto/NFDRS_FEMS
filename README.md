# NFDRS_FEMS

Tool that downloads FEMS data for stations of interest, and processes it to create percentile lookup tables & NFDRS charts for each index. Calculations are performed at 3 scales: GACC, PSA, and Station.

Users must provide the included [StationList.csv](https://github.com/mpanunto/NFDRS_FEMS/blob/main/StationList.csv) as input to the tool. This CSV file has the Northern California Geographic Area Coordination Center (ONCC) stations listed by default, but it can be modified to download & process the user's desired stations.
